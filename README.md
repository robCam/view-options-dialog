# view-options-dialog

**view-options-dialog** is created using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript developed by [Rob Campbell](https://github.com/robCam/).

This is single page web app to demonstrate a JavaScript prototype for a view options dialog for an app/e-reader.

It's all hand crafted custom code and does not use any JS framework.

Further documentation for usage, showing configuration options, js methods etc, can be generated using grunt (see below);

You'll need to:

1. Install node.js.
1. Install npm.
1. Run 'npm install'.
1. Run 'grunt' to produce a distribution build and 'grunt docs' to generate documentation.
